## Introduction

This repository is intended for learners and practitioners of machine learning. By providing implementations of popular algorithms, both from scratch and using a library, we aim to deepen understanding of how these algorithms work and how to apply them effectively.

## Algorithms

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple yet powerful supervised learning algorithm, used for classification and regression purposes. Its work is based on the principle that similar data points are close to each other in feature space.
 
- **Implementation from Scratch:** This is demonstrating how the KNN algorithm works under the hood.
- **Implementation using scikit-learn :** This implementation makes use of the functionality of the sklearn library to come up with a simple and efficient KNN classification.
- **Code:** You can find the code [here](KNN).
